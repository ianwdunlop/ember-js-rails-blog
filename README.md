Ember JS: Server side
=====================

Use this code in conjunction with http://dev.mygrid.org.uk/blog/?p=121 to create a Ruby on Rails
application to persist data from an Ember JS client side app. The rails app also serves as the
application server for the Ember JS javascript files. See http://dev.mygrid.org.uk/blog/?p=46 and 
https://github.com/ianwdunlop/ember-js-mvc-blog-tutorial for more details on the Ember side of the
application.
